# TODO 
- more comprehensive testing
- fix problem with typing into input field only 1 value at a time
- Replace mock submit functionality with a more robust form handling - react-hook-form
- introduce accessibility testing
- optimise code into some smaller chunks
- make html a little more semantic
- share styles, especially dimensions like margin, padding, width into one location to allow quicker theming
- responsive testing
- merge both cypress coverage and vitest coverage into 1.
- setup a pre-commit hook to enforce linting, typescript percentage and coverage for ci pipeline

# Building time estimated work log
- React/vitest/cypress and cypress coverage boilerplate: 7hrs
https://github.com/inspiraller/vite-react-cypress-coverage

- Using above boilerplate: Point of sale tech test: 8hrs
- Estimate another 8hrs for about 80% test coverage

thankyou for the puzzle.
